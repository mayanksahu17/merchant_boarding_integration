Yes, you're almost correct — let me help you **refine the flow** with proper roles and API integration steps. Here’s a **cleaned-up version** of the onboarding journey you’re describing, tailored to your sales workflow with PaymentsHub's Merchant Boarding API:

---

### ✅ **Your Sales-Based Merchant Onboarding Flow**

#### 🧑‍💼 Step 1: Sales Team Books Appointment (Manual or CRM-driven)

* Your sales rep talks to a merchant.
* They qualify the lead (basic info, interest level, etc.).

---

#### 📤 Step 2: Sales Rep Sends Onboarding Link (via API)

* Your internal system:

  * Authenticates using the **Client ID / Secret**
  * Calls `Create Application` API with merchant’s basic details
  * Generates onboarding link via `trigger-signature`
* The merchant gets an email with the official form link from PaymentsHub to **complete & sign** their application.

---

#### ✍️ Step 3: Merchant Completes Application

* Merchant fills out the full application via the email link.
* They **submit and sign** electronically.

---

#### ✅ Step 4: Application Submitted to Underwriting

* You (or the backend automatically):

  * Call the **Submit Application API** after signature is complete
* The app is sent to **PaymentsHub's Underwriting team**.

---

#### ⏳ Step 5: Poll Status Until Approval

* Use `GET /application/{id}/status` periodically.
* Once status is `APPROVED`, you will receive a **MID (Merchant ID)**.

---

#### 📦 Step 6: POS Machine Sent to Merchant

* Now that merchant is approved:

  * You assign a terminal or initiate POS shipping from your fulfillment team.
  * This can be a manual CRM update or automated via webhook.
